## About
A dynamic service that allows you to search for movies on demand and save them in your personal account.

Here's a sneak peek into what went behind the scenes:
- Laid the groundwork with robust infrastructure and brought an Express server to life.
- Established a connection to the database, sculpted API schemas, and resource models to ensure seamless data flow.
- Fortified the server with sophisticated logging, bulletproof authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
- Deployed the backend magic on Yandex Cloud, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- Breathed life into the frontend with React, transforming static markup into interactive experiences.
- Crafted the user journey with meticulous attention to registration, login, profile customization, and managing saved movies.
- Mastered asynchronous magic with requests to the API, making the app responsive.
- Delved into the nuances of user experience, fine-tuning the app to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized states and enabling users to curate their movie collections.
- Implemented client-side filtering to swiftly navigate through the ocean of movies.
